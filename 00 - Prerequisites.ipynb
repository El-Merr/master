    "### Guide: Installing packages on Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing packages on Windows is somewhat different with that on macOS and Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "TL;DR: Directly go to \"Summary\" if you don't want to experience the pains again. :)\n",
    "\n",
    "**First**, although 32-bit Windows works with other packages, you MUST have a 64-bit Windows to run TensorFlow. TensorFlow requires Visual C++ 2015 Update 3 runtime, you can download it from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53840).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next**, you have to download and install Anaconda3 version 4.1 ([installer EXE](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.1.1-Windows-x86_64.exe)) from its [installer archive](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/index.html). Choosing this specific version is because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Currently, TensorFlow for Windows [requires Python 3.5](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/os_setup#pip_installation_on_windows). It does not work with newer Python 3.6 released in December 2016.\n",
    "2. Anaconda3 4.1 and 4.2 provide Python 3.5. Anaconda3 4.3 provides Python 3.6.\n",
    "3. According to hours of failure, installing TensorFlow on Anaconda3 4.2 makes errors like \"padding error\" and illegal UTF-8 sequence to occur. This happens when you are trying to update Qt, which is a dependency of `matplotlib`. A solution is describe [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/pull/54#issuecomment-274660803), which suggest breaking changes in version 4.2 lead to those bugs. Main conclusion: keep `conda` version below 4.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you shouldn't execute the `conda install numpy scipy ...` command since this command will upgrade `conda` to the newest version (currently 4.3) automatically. Whether the installed versions of these packages are sufficient is to be tested. But you can use `pip` to upgrade them.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, if you are interested, you can try to build SciPy with GPU acceleration (mainly BLAS/LAPACK). It is really time-costing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finally**, install TensorFlow. The channel conda-forge on Anaconda provides a [Win64 build](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/tensorflow). But if you try to install it by executing `conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow`, it will force you to upgrade packages (including `conda`) to those matching that channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, you have to install TensorFlow via `pip`. However, the method shown on TensorFlow's help page doesn't work and it will say something like \"Cannot remove entries from nonexistent file\". Luckily someone found a [solution](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/135#issuecomment-155788972): download the selected wheel to your computer, and then install locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow provides two types of wheel: one [with GPU acceleration](https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-0.12.1-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl) (via CUDA), and one [without](https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-0.12.1-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl). If you are a developer of NVidia's Accelerated Computing Developer Program, think about downloading the one with GPU acceleration. CUDA SDKs are only available to those in the Program.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure your PC is running a 64-bit Windows.\n",
    "2. Download and install Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Runtime from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53840). (Update 3 is included in this link.)\n",
    "3. Download and install Anaconda3 4.1 from [here](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.1.1-Windows-x86_64.exe).\n",
    "4. Download TensorFlow 0.12.1 from [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/windows/cpu/tensorflow-0.12.1-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl).\n",
    "5. Install TensorFlow: `pip install C:\\TensorFlow\\Download\\Location\\tensorflow-0.12.1-cp35-cp35m-win_amd64.whl`.\n",
